# Embedded Systems Projects üöÄ

This repository contains a collection of **Arduino and embedded systems projects** that demonstrate the use of various sensors, modules, and programming concepts in electronics. These projects are great for learning, prototyping, and building real-world applications.  

## üìÇ Project List  

1. **Ultrasonic Distance Measurement System**  
   - Uses an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) to measure the distance of objects.  
   - Displays output on the serial monitor or LCD.  

2. **Fire Alarm System**  
   - Detects fire or smoke using a flame sensor/gas sensor.  
   - Triggers buzzer and LED alerts.  

3. **Light Intensity Detector (LDR)**  
   - Monitors ambient light levels using an LDR.  
   - Can be used for automatic lighting systems.  

4. **Password-Protected Security System**  
   - A keypad-based system that requires the correct password to unlock.  
   - Useful for doors, lockers, or digital authentication.  

5. **Temperature Monitoring System**  
   - Uses a temperature sensor (LM35/DHT11) to measure and display temperature.  
   - Can trigger alarms for extreme conditions.  

6. **IR Remote-Controlled LED System**  
   - Controls LEDs using an infrared remote.  
   - Demonstrates IR communication with Arduino.  

7. **Arduino Calculator**  
   - A calculator made with a keypad and Arduino.  
   - Performs basic arithmetic operations.
